#  Stock Analysis Refactoring

## Overview of Project
A visualization and interpretation of refactoring VBA code to run faster.

### Purpose
Using a curated stock price dataset that includes fields such as dates, volumes, and prices, this report will attempt to show how refactoring VBA code makes it more efficient.  The focus of the report will be refactoring code running against the years 2017 and 2018.

## Results

### Stock performance from 2018 compared to 2017
1. Only two stocks increased in value from the end of 2017 to the end of 2018.
a. One possible reason that many of the energy stocks in this selection lost value in 2018 was due to energy policies of the Trump Administration being hostile towards alternative forms of energy production.
2. The amount of time it took to .

### Outcomes Based on Goals
1. Significant success can be found in setting a modest goal (less than $15,000) for funding.
2. Failure of funding rises precipitously as goal amount increases.

### Limitations of the dataset
- Clearly, not having more current data may skew the numbers.  Having just come out the other side of a global pandemic, spending habits for small dollar donors may have changed.
- Different genres of plays / musicals / etc. would be helpful, allowing us to drill down even further to reach conclusions about different types of live performances.

### Data or Tables that should be added
- One enhancement to the Outcomes Based on Goals should be a weight given to the amount of data in the lower ranges.  Over 90% of all goals were under $15,000, so making sweeping conclusions about more expensive or ambitious plays is difficult.
