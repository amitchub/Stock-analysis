## Summary
The script written for the election analysis can be extended to support elections in other districts, municipalities, states, or the whole country.  The data would just need more columns to indicate what state or city the data was collected from.  The script could also very easily be modified to analyze the demographics of the voters.  Once again, the data would just need more columns to characterize the demographics desired for each voter.
